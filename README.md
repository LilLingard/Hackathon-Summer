# Hackathon-Summer-2024 GO MJCG Lab!
Best team in the 2024 Hackathon❤️
## Announcements
The time zone will be assumed to be Eastern time.

Gary might miss the next meeting.
## Meeting Plans
The next meeting will be on **08/14/24 10 A.M. (eastern time)**
## Meeting Summary
### 8/13
* **Different Approach?**

Is there another way to figure out this problem? "Translating gene into peak" might not be the best solution.
* **Utilizing the Files**

The other three files (ATAC, RNA, and Meta) are there for a reason.

* **Setwd**

Need to figure out how to run the shell file correctly.
### 8/12
* **Understanding what peak represents**

Example: chr1-89196985-89201657 (chromosome location-peak start unit-peak end unit)
* **Understanding what makes the peak correlate with the gene**

The crucial part of the gene should fall into the peak to make the peak and the gene correlate.
## Tasks
Gary will continue the gene-to-peak approach and try to find a model for it. Besides that, **understanding the other three files and run Code.to.Check.Data.sh** will be the main focuses.
